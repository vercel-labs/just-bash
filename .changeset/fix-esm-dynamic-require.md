"just-bash": patch

Fix `Dynamic require of "tty" is not supported` crash when invoking commands that transitively load `debug` / `supports-color` (notably `file`) under ESM Node consumers and via the `just-bash` CLI binary.

The esbuild dynamic-require shim emitted into the ESM Node bundles had no `require` to delegate to at chunk-init under ESM, so any runtime `require("tty")` / `require("os")` from `file-type` → `debug` chain threw. Build banners now provide `createRequire(import.meta.url)` for `build:lib`, `build:cli`, and `build:shell`. CJS and browser bundles are unchanged.

Fixes #211.
