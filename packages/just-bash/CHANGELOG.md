## 2.14.4

### Patch Changes

- [#206](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/206) [`6ccc35f`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/6ccc35f5a9b5c6f395b145ed2ec7ee71c4862057) Thanks [@subsetpark](https://github.com/subsetpark)! - Fix awk lexer to honor POSIX statement continuation across newlines after `,`,
  `{`, `&&`, `||`, `?`, `:`, `do`, `else`, `if`, and `while`. Previously, a
  multi-line idiom like `printf "%s=%d\n", \n  $1, $2` (comma at end-of-line
  followed by indented args on the next line) failed with `Unexpected token:
NEWLINE` because the lexer emitted a NEWLINE token unconditionally. The
  lexer now suppresses the NEWLINE when it immediately follows one of the
  continuation-allowing tokens, matching POSIX awk.

- [#199](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/199) [`3d11f05`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/3d11f05959faa205267a5173b25665c6732fee8b) Thanks [@cramforce](https://github.com/cramforce)! - Internal: convert repository to a pnpm workspace under `packages/just-bash` and adopt Changesets for versioning. No public API changes; `import` paths and the `bin` entries are unchanged.
